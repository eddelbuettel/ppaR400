Description: GNU R debug symbols for statistical comp. language and environment
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbol tables for the binaries and dynamic
 libraries in the r-base-core package.

 This package is a metapackage which eases the transition from the

 can be safely removed and apt-get will automatically upgrade its components
 during future upgrades.  Providing this package gives a way to users to
 then only install r-base-core if they so desire.

Description: GNU R scripting and command-line front-end
 The 'r' (aka 'littler') program provides a lightweight binary wrapper around
 the GNU R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
 .
 While R can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support for
 both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hashmark-exclamation-path
 expression as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in
 standard Unix pipelines. In other words, r provides the R language without
 the environment.

Description: GNU R package for Armadillo C++ linear algebra library
 Armadillo is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad Sanderson)
 that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
 floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
 trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
 provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
 .
 A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine
 several operations into one, and to reduce (or eliminate) the need for
 temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template
 meta-programming.
 .
 This library is useful if C++ has been decided as the language of choice
 (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language.
 .
 The RcppArmadillo package includes the header files from the
 templated Armadillo library. Thus users do not need to install
 Armadillo itself in order to use RcppArmadillo.
 .
 This Armadillo integration provides a nice illustration of the
 capabilities of the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++ integration.
 .
 Armadillo is licensed under the MPL 2.0, while RcppArmadillo (the Rcpp
 bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2
 or later, as is the rest of Rcpp.

Description: GNU R html manuals for statistical computing system
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package provides the R manuals in html format. The sibling packages
 r-doc-pdf and r-doc-info provides the same manuals.

 itself, as well as directly via the CRAN network of mirrors. This set
 comprises the following packages (listed in their upstream names):

    operations on them using Lapack and SuiteSparse
  - MASS, class, nnet and spatial: packages from Venables and Ripley,

  - boot: Bootstrap R (S-Plus) Functions from the book "Bootstrap Methods
    and Their Applications" by A.C. Davison and D.V. Hinkley (1997).
